		<h3>What is 3D Printing?</h3>
		<h4><b>What is it?</b></h4>
		<br>Three-dimensional (or 3D) printing is the process of using a plastic or plastic-infused materials, like PLA, ABS, Resin, etc., in order to build an
		object in three-dimensional space. There are multiple types of 3D printers, the two most common being a hot extrusion printer, where the plastic is 
		pushed out through a hot nozzle, varying between 180 degrees Celsius and 250 degrees Celsius. The other most common type of printer is usually called a
		Resin Printer, and it is the process of using a liquid resin, which is highly sensitive to light, and usually a UV light in order to build the object 
		that is wanted. These printers are more complicated to understand and use, however it is still a very popular 3D printer.

		<h4>Important Terms to Know</h4><br>
		<h2>Filament Printers</h2><br>
		<b>Extruder</b>- A motor and a device that is able to control the feed of the plastic up through the Bowden tube to the nozzle.<br>
		<b>Frame</b>- The frame of the printer is what keeps all the parts together and allows the other parts to operate on or from.<br>
		<b>Cooling Fan</b>- Cools the plastic as it is coming out of the nozzle to make sure that adhesion occurs properly.<br>
		<b>Nozzle</b>- This is where the plastic comes out and onto the print bed. The nozzle gets very hot depending on what type of material the printer is using.<br>
		<b>Print Bed</b>- The print bed is what the plastic is going to stick too. These beds are fully metal and then have a plate on top of them, so the plastic is able to stick to it. Some beds are made out of a flexible material, and some beds are made out of glass.<br>
		<b>Power Supply</b>-The power supply for each printer varies from model to model. The printer may require more power depending on the size of the other components or if it is running a larger printer. Vertically mounting the power supply isnâ€™t that common, however, if a larger power supply is needed, some printers have them separate from the printer just attached by a cable. <br>  
		<b>Motherboard</b>- The motherboard controls all aspects of the printer. It tells each motor what to do, it tells the nozzle and the bed what temperature to go to. It runs the operating system that a printer uses and is able to auto update. <br>
		<b>Dispay Screen</b>- This allows the user to select the model to print, along with controlling the position of the x-axis and y-axis of the bed, the z-axis of the nozzle, and is able to control temperatures.
