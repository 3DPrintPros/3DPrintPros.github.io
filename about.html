		<h3>What is 3D Printing?</h3>
		<p>
		<h4><b>What is it?</b></h4>
		<br>Three-dimensional (or 3D) printing is the process of using a plastic or plastic-infused materials, like PLA, ABS, Resin, etc., in order to build an
		object in three-dimensional space. There are multiple types of 3D printers, the two most common being a hot extrusion printer, where the plastic is 
		pushed out through a hot nozzle, varying between 180 degrees Celsius and 250 degrees Celsius. The other most common type of printer is usually called a
		Resin Printer, and it is the process of using a liquid resin, which is highly sensitive to light, and usually a UV light in order to build the object 
		that is wanted. These printers are more complicated to understand and use, however it is still a very popular 3D printer.
