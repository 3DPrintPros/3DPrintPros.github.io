		<h4><b>Mission Statement:</b> The mission of the Yale School of Art is to provide students with intellectually informed, hands-on instruction in 
		the practice of an array of visual arts media within the context of a liberal arts university.</h4>
		<br>
			The Yale School of Art is a graduate school that confers MFAs in Graphic Design, Painting/Printmaking, Photography, and Sculpture; 
			and offers undergraduate-level art courses to Yale College students. Our website exists as an ongoing collaborative experiment in 
			digital publishing and information sharing. It functions as a wiki—all members of the School of Art community have the ability to 
			add new, and edit most existing, content.
		<br><br>
			Artists and designers of unusual promise and strong motivation are provided an educational context in which they can explore the 
			potential of their own talents in the midst of an intense critical dialogue. This dialogue is generated by their peers, by distinguished 
			visitors, and by a faculty comprised of professional artists of acknowledged accomplishment.
		<br><br>
			The graduate student’s primary educational experience at Yale is centered on the student’s own studio activity. Supporting this enterprise 
			are the experience, knowledge, and skills gained from rigorous, structured courses such as drawing, filmmaking, the relativity of color, and 
			the rich academic offerings found throughout Yale. Each student is routinely exposed to many aesthetic positions through encounters with faculty 
			members and visitors. The School is devoted not only to the refinement of visual skills, but also to the cultivation of the mind. Students must 
			bring creative force and imagination to their own development, for these qualities cannot be taught—they can only be stimulated and appreciated.
		<br><br>
			The School of Art offers an undergraduate art major for students in Yale College (see the bulletin Yale College Programs of Study). In addition, 
			the School’s courses are open to students in the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences and other professional schools of the University, and School 
			of Art students may enroll in elective courses in the Graduate School and other professional schools as well as in the College with permission.
