				<h3><b>Habitat for Humanity:</b> 3D Printed House</h3>
				<p>
					On Tuesday, December 21, at 10:30 a.m., Habitat for Humanity is going to be celebrating the first 3D printed house. This is the first
					3D printed house that is fully livable on the east coast. This house is located in Williamsburg, Virginia.
					<br>
					This house is built in partnership with Alquist, a 3D printing home construction company. This company used the COBOD 3D Printer, which
					is a state of the art large scale printer. This home is approzimately 1,200 square-feet, with three bedrooms and two full baths. The build
					material of the house is solid concrete so there isn't going to be any worry about the house breaking down or blowing away. The company
					hopes to be able to continue their work all around the U.S., building homes for the future. Check out the full article on the WYDAILY
					website <a href="https://wydaily.com/news/2021/12/13/habitat-for-humanity-to-celebrate-the-completion-of-3d-printed-house/">here.</a>
