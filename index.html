				<h3><b>JJJJJerome Ellis:</b> On Fugitive Speech</h3>
				<p>
					Inaugurated during the summer of 2020 in an effort to address the NOW, the Yale School of Art’s Speak to Me series 
					continues into the fall semester with a special presentation by composer, poet, and performer JJJJJerome Ellis. 
					The public virtual event, organized during the Yale School of Art’s 150th anniversary year as a co-educational professional 
					school of art, emerges from Diving Into the Wreck: Rethinking Critical Practices, the first-year MFA course taught by Stavros 
					Niarchos Foundation Dean and Professor of Art, Marta Kuzma. 
					<br>
					The School of Art is honored to welcome JJJJJerome Ellis as a Speak to Me guest, to deliver a performative address which centers 
					around the poetics and politics of Black dysfluency. The artist’s ongoing practice of spelling his name “JJJJJerome” is a reflection 
					of the Afro-Caribbean composer, poet, and performer’s personal relationship with the subject matter: “…the word I stutter on most frequently 
					is my name.” The event will be introduced by Dean Marta Kuzma, followed by JJJJJerome Ellis’ presentation of “On Fugitive Speech,” and concluded by a Q&A.
